Kinect2CloudRecorder
====================
Converts kinect's (v2) RGB and Depth stream into .ply objects
It makes use of Kinect SDK 2.0

How to compile it
====================
As this project uses OpenFrameworks (0.8.4) you should clone it inside
openframeworks/apps/[anyname]/Kinect2CloudRecorder

This is a requirement as VisualStudio will look for Open Frameworks libraries
from ../../../

OpenFrameworks Addons required
==============================
ofxXmlSettings 
ofxUI


Current Project Stage
=====================
In development. Kinect2CloudRecorder should be able to display an RGB frame on screen (Currently not working for unknown reasons)
